# Atlas
Repositorio de Proyecto Atlas
Atlas is a project which aims to be a tool to create routines for different disciplines such as strongman, weightlifting, crossfit, functional or any desired training.
Users can also subscribe to the routines created by teachers/coaches, test them, rate them and follow them, saving their progress over time.
Currently I am looking to create this application with the best practices of programming as well as making the process a tool to learn from the best technologies, patterns, architecture and security of today.
Please feel free to comment on improvements and any criticism you have, it will help me a lot.
